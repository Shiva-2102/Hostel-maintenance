Hostel Maintenance Priority System 

Fix What Matters First

Project Overview :
The Hostel Maintenance Priority System is a web-based application designed to help hostel authorities manage student complaints efficiently.
The system automatically assigns priority to complaints so that critical issues are resolved first.

Problem Statement :
In hostels, maintenance complaints such as electrical failures, water leakage, sanitation issues, and damaged furniture are usually handled without priority.
This causes delays, safety risks, and student dissatisfaction.

Solution :
This project provides:
A simple complaint submission system for students
An automatic priority assignment mechanism
A warden dashboard to view and manage issues based on urgency

Key Features :
Student complaint registration
Automatic priority classification:
🔴 Critical
🟠 High
🟡 Medium
🟢 Low
Warden dashboard to view all complaints
Simple and user-friendly interface
Lightweight backend using Node.js & Express
